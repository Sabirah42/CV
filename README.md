## About Me
Full-stack Junior Software Developer with a background in Human Resources, specialising in Mental Health and Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI). With over 12 years of experience, I have worked in large businesses to start-ups in the private, not-for-profit and charity sectors. I pride myself on building great relationships with clients, leading with empathy, patience and humour.

Realising that the majority of my career highlights were centred around using technology to create efficiencies and improve people's lives, I decided to make a drastic change and apply for an intensive coding skills bootcamp, securing a highly competitive scholarship with Makers Academy.

Having successfully completed the course, I am excited about finding a tech-forward company in which I can further enhance my engineering skills and make a real impact.
